## Description
Welcome to my Portfolio Website, I did stray from the template design because I wanted to experiment with a idea of what i wanted. I do have some external JS in here that i found while watching youtube videos and scouring google. this is my 3rd version of this website. I made a Sketch on Figma(Images below) but ultimately decided to go for something else. I am expecting to get points deducted for not following the Template design but ill make something else later down the course which will look similar to it.
